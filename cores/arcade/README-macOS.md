# FinalBurn Neo for macOS

## Download
[Version 1.03](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases/tag/macos-v1.03) is the
latest stable release. [View all releases](https://github.com/fbn-mac/FBNeo/releases).

## Compatibility
Emulator has been tested successfully on High Sierra and above, though it's very
likely that it may run on earlier versions (perhaps as low as Mountain Lion). If you
can build and run successfully on an earlier version of macOS (OS X?), let me know.

## Use
Drop a set into the Launcher window to import it, double-click to start it.
Supported archive formats are  `zip` and `7z`.

You can also use `File/Open` and `File/Open Recent` to load ROMs directly.
Files can reside anywhere, though when loading a game that requires a parent set
or BIOS (e.g. Neo-Geo), the files are expected to be in the same directory.

If a game refuses to start, check the Log Viewer (Window/Log Viewer)
for diagnostic information.

## Input
Currently supported input devices are keyboard (using standard FinalBurn layout)
and mouse.

## Known issues
* Joysticks are currently unsupported
