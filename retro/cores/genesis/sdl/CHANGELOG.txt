 [06/21/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* added Multitap support (EA 4-Way Play and Sega Teamplayer): allowed up to four players in games supporting those peripherals
* added partial Sega Menacer lightgun support (use Analog Stick): automatically set when detecting the 6-in-1 Menacer game

 [05/18/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* you can now switch between FM cores without reseting the game. FM registers  value are automatically restored when switching.
* removed the previous VINT timings modification because it brokes some games (Rocket Knight, Thunderforce III,...)
* added automatic Timing configuration (VDP latency, VINT timing & alternate Line Timing) at game loading, based upon specific romname detection.
This means you can still modify some of these options afterwards but they are now automatically set/unset when loading a game which need
special timing fixes. These fixes are also automatically desactivated when the current game doesn't need them.
For information, games that are actually detected and need special timings to run properly are:
 .Legend of Galahad & Road Rash series (single line not rendered properly)
 .Sesame Street Counting Cafe (don't boot)
 .Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune (graphic glitches on scrolling)

 [05/08/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* VINT timings are now a little more accurate: fixes Sesame's Street Counting Cafe
* SN76496 MAX_OUTPUT back to normal
* modified FB_WNOISE value in SN76496 core according to John Kortink's last informations
* added support for Maxim's PSG core, same as used in SMSPLUS (it becomes the default PSG core)
* updated FM core to the latest MAME version
* corrected DAC output level (fixes voices and some special FX being too low)
* added support for Gens YM2612 (FM) core (MAME's one still remains default FM core)
* added configurable preamplification for each sound cores (see Emulator Options)
* added some other configurable sound options (boost overall volume, FM improvment for Gens YM2612)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [04/11/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* corrected MAX_OUTPUT value in SN76496 core: fix PSG sound (SFX) volume


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [03/17/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * added an option to enable alternate line rendering timing (fix single line error in Road Rash series and Legend of Galahad's Intro)
 * Color RAM update now always reset color 0 to border color (fix color glitches in Mortal Kombat,...) (thanks to Noop's for the idea)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [03/09/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* modified HV counter tables (fix graphic glitches in Skitchin's sky, Lotus 2 Recs, Panorama Cotton, Dashin Desperados & maybe more)
* completely rewrote DMA timings emulation so that it works for all games (no more cpu freezing)
* added all DMA tranfer rates handling for each three DMA modes and added dma busy flag emulation
* modified interrupts handling on VDP register #0 and #1 writes (fix Lemmings status bar)
* added VDP RAM write latency  (fix Chaos Engine/Soldier of Fortune gfx glitches)
* modified FM timers handling a bit (fix Vectorman2 music)
* corrected Sprite Limit rendering (fix Sonic 1 & Micromachines 2 title screens)
* corrected IO Registers writes (fix Decap' Attack controls, no more need for alternate input)
* corrected 6 Buttons Pad emulation (fix 6buttons detection in Mortal Kombat 3, Comix Zone and other 6-buttons compatible games)
* modified sound mixing a bit according to Generator sourcecode (FM and PSG ratios seems more correct)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [02/07/07] (Eke-Eke)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* fixed fm timers (fix missing music in Castle of Illusion, Quackshot, Undead Line, Wonderboy in Monster Lair, Cal 50, Turbo Outrun, Thundeforce 4 and maybe more)
* added complete EEPROM emulation (save support now works fine in Wonderboy5, Megaman Willy Wars, NBA Jam...)  (credits to Notaz, adapted from Picodrive code)
* added preliminar dma timing emulation (fix bottom screen in Legend of Galahad) (credits to Notaz, adapted from Picodrive code)
* hack: clear Vint pending after Hint (INT level 4) acknowledge (fix Fatal Rewind)
* hack: modify read_bus16 to return a random value (fake fetch) (fix Time Killers)
* modified cpu execution timings, with more correct hblank and interrupts timing  (fix ISS Deluxe, Double Dragon 2 and certainly more) (Based on Gens code)
* modified busreq mechanism: better synchro between z80 & 68k (no need to dejitter anymore) (Based on Gens code)
* added sprite collision detection (fix Strider 2)
* modified dma fill operation for big endian platform (fix Contra Hardcorps gfx garbage)

 [05/25/03] (Charles MacDonald)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a typo that made Z80 banked access to the VDP registers always fail.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [05/17/03] (Charles MacDonald)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Modified the rendering code to handle unaligned longword access to memory.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [04/20/03] (Charles MacDonald)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Modified 68000 emulator to prevent 'tas.b $mem' from writing data back
   after a read (fixes Gargoyles).
 * Fixed bug in 68000 emulator to swap order of words written for address
   register indirect pre-decremented writes (fixes Jim Power graphics).
 * Added support for 240-line displays (for Super Skidmarks).
 * Rewrote part of the interrupt handling (fixes some raster effects).
 * Removed sprite collision detection code (never really worked).
 * Optimized sprite rendering inner loop.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [04/13/03] (Charles MacDonald)

 * Fixed bit 7 handling of control register in I/O chip.
 * Finished up Z80 memory map.
 * Added code to handle Genesis hardware lock-ups.
 * Removed some faulty code from the 68000 memory map handlers.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [03/22/03] (Charles MacDonald)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Completed implementation of Z80 banked memory handlers.
