<P>The purpose of this dialog is to choose a game to play. When you click on a game in the list the dialog will display a preview image of the game if you have a PNG file in the folder you have defined as your previews folder with the games short name (the same applies to a screenshot of the games title screen, if a file exists in the titles folder). The info panel under the gamelist will also be refreshed and will display information about the game.</P>

<P>To play a game either double-click on it in the list, or select it and press the <B>Play</B> button.</P>

<P>The game list can be filtered using any of the filters in the dialog. This allows you to filter by <B>Hardware</B>, <B>Favorites</B>, <B>Genre</B>, <B>Family</B> (Game Series), or <B>Board Type</B>. Once you (de)select a filter the game list is automatically refreshed. (De)selecting a parent filter will (de)select all the child filters below it. You can also search using the search box in the dialog. Typing in this box will filter the gamelist based on what you typed.</P>
