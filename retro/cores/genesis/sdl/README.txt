
DISCLAIMER:

THIS IS A VERY BASIC & UNSTABLE PORT WHICH ONLY PURPOSE
IS TO SHOW HOW TO USE GENESIS PLUS GX CORE & INTERFACE IT
WITH SDL IN PARTICULAR. BUILDS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE REALLY
USED FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT EASIER CORE DEBUGGING ON WINDOWS.
PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WIN32 BINARIES WITHOUT THIS NOTICE.
END USERS SHOULD PREFERABLY USE LIBRETRO PORT WITH RETROARCH.
