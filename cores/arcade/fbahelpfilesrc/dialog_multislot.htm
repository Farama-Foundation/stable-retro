<P>The purpose of this dialog is to choose which Neo-Geo MVS games to load. There are six slots available in which a game can be loaded. To load a game in a slot, click the relevant <B>Select</B> button. This will open the <A HREF="dialog_game_select.htm">Game Select Dialog</A>, showing only MVS cartridges, allowing you to choose a game to load in the slot. To clear a game from a slot, click the relevant <B>Clear</B> button.</P>

<P>When you have made your selections, click the <B>OK</B> button to start the MVS Multislot driver with your games loaded. Once you enter a credit, before starting a game you can select which game to play by pressing the <B>select</B> buttons. By default these are mapped to <B>3</B> and <B>4</B> on your keyboard. Pressing these buttons will cycle through the games you have loaded.</P>

<P>Your slot selections are saved when the dialog is closed.</P>
