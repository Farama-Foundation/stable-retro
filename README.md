# Stable-Retro

A fork of [gym-retro](https://github.com/openai/retro) ('lets you turn classic video games into Gymnasium environments for reinforcement learning') with additional games, emulators and supported platforms. Since gym-retro is in maintenance now and doesn't accept new games, platforms or bug fixes, you can instead submit PRs with new games or features here in stable-retro.

Currently added games on top of gym-retro:
*	Super Mario Bros 2 Japan (Lost Levels) - NES
*	Hang On - SMS
*	Punch Out - NES
*	WWF Wrestlemania the Arcade Game - Genesis
*	NHL 94 - Genesis
*	NHL 94 (1 on 1 rom hack) - Genesis
*	Super Hang On - Genesis
*	Tetris - GameBoy
*	Virtua Fighter - 32x
*	Virtua Fighter 2 - Genesis
*	Virtua Fighter 2 - Saturn
*	Mortal Kombat 1 - Sega CD

PvP games that support two models fighting each other:
*	Samurai Showdown - Genesis
*	WWF Wrestlemania the Arcade Game - Genesis
*	Mortal Kombat II - Genesis
*	NHL 94 - Genesis

As well as additional states on already integrated games.

## ROMs

Each game integration has files listing memory locations for in-game variables, reward functions based on those variables, episode end conditions, savestates at the beginning of levels and a file containing hashes of ROMs that work with these files.

Please note that ROMs are not included and you must obtain them yourself.  Most ROM hashes are sourced from their respective No-Intro SHA-1 sums.

The following non-commercial ROMs are included with Stable Retro for testing purposes:
