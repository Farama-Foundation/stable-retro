/**
  This class implements a Serializer device, whereby data is serialized and
  read from/written to a binary stream in a system-independent way.  The
  stream can be either an actual file, or an in-memory structure.

  Bytes are written as characters, shorts as 2 characters (16-bits),
  integers as 4 characters (32-bits), strings are written as characters
  prepended by the length of the string, boolean values are written using
  a special character pattern.

  All bytes, shorts and ints should be cast to their appropriate data type upon
  method return.
