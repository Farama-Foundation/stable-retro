Description: Libretro wrapper for Genesis Plus GX
 This wrapper makes Genesis Plus GX API compatible with libretro, thus allowing
 its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on accuracy
 and portability. Initially ported and developed on Gamecube / Wii consoles
 only through libogc / devkitPPC, it is now available on many other platforms
 through various frontends.
 .
 The source code, originally based on Genesis Plus 1.3 by Charles MacDonald, has
 been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to initial goals and design, in
 order to improve the accuracy of emulation, implementing new features and
 adding support for extra peripherals, cartridge & systems hardware.
 .
 The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the original
 project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation and 100%
 compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System, Game Gear
 & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed or pirate known dumps),
 also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available.
