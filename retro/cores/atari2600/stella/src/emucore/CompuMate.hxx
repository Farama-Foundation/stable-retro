/**
  Handler for SpectraVideo CompuMate bankswitched games.

  The specifics of the CompuMate format can be found in both the Cart side
  (CartCM) and the Controller side (CMControl).  The CompuMate device is
  unique for the 2600 in that it requires close co-operation between the
  cartridge and the left and right controllers.

  This class acts as a 'parent' for cartridge and both the left and right
  CMControl's, taking care of their creation and communication between them.
  It also allows to enable/disable the users actual keyboard when required.

      In normal key-handling mode, the update handler receives key events

      Otherwise, the update handler ignores keys from the keyboard and uses
      its own internal buffer, which essentially can only be set directly
      within the class itself (by the debugger).

      This is necessary since Stella is otherwise event-based, whereas
      reading from the keyboard (in the current code) bypasses the event
      system.  This leads to issues where typing commands in the debugger
      would then be processed by the update handler as if they were
      entered on the CompuMate keyboard.
