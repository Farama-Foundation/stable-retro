\
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
