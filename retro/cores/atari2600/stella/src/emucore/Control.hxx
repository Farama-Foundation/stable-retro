/**
  A controller is a device that plugs into either the left or right
  controller jack of the Video Computer System (VCS).  The pins of
  the controller jacks are mapped as follows:

                           -------------
                           \ 1 2 3 4 5 /
                            \ 6 7 8 9 /
                             ---------

            Left Controller             Right Controller

    pin 1   D4  PIA SWCHA               D0  PIA SWCHA
    pin 2   D5  PIA SWCHA               D1  PIA SWCHA
    pin 3   D6  PIA SWCHA               D2  PIA SWCHA
    pin 4   D7  PIA SWCHA               D3  PIA SWCHA
    pin 5   D7  TIA INPT1 (Dumped)      D7  TIA INPT3 (Dumped)
    pin 6   D7  TIA INPT4 (Latched)     D7  TIA INPT5 (Latched)
    pin 7   +5                          +5
    pin 8   GND                         GND
    pin 9   D7  TIA INPT0 (Dumped)      D7  TIA INPT2 (Dumped)

  Each of the pins connected to the PIA can be configured as an
  input or output pin.  The "dumped" TIA pins are used to charge
  a capacitor.  A potentiometer is sometimes connected to these
  pins for analog input.

  This is a base class for all controllers.  It provides a view
  of the controller from the perspective of the controller's jack.
