/**
  The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased video game controller intended for
  release in 1984.  The Mindlink was unique in that one had to move the
  muscles in one's head to control the game. These movements would be read by
  infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game.  For more
  information, see the following link:

    http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/mindlink.html

  This code was heavily borrowed from z26, and uses conventions defined
  there.  Specifically, IOPortA is treated as a complete uInt8, whereas
  the Stella core actually stores this information in boolean arrays
  addressable by DigitalPin number.
