Pre-Building:

1) download and run visual studio 2019 IDE community edition installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ 
2) select Desktop development with C++
3) next you will need a perl interpreter for windows. I recommend ActivePerl (https://www.activestate.com/products/activeperl/downloads/). I usually use the oldest version available. Make sure that you have enabled the checkbox to add perl to the current path.
4) Then you need NASM for the assembly files. Go here: https://www.nasm.us/ and download the latest stable version. You need to put nasm.exe somewhere in your path. As I am a savage I have always put it in my windows directory, but I do not recommend this for a number of reasons.

Building
1) checkout the code using git (Optionally: fork it first!)
2) in the checked out code, open projectfiles then visualstudio-2019, then open fba_vs2019.sln
3) select the correctly platform and build type. 
4) hit build!
